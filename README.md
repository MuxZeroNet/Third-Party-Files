# Third-Party Files
ZeroBundle is a convenient package that makes ZeroNet portable. Since all required libraries are packed into the bundle, packaging gets so complicated that it is super easy to fail to keep all dependencies up-to-date.

This repository keeps track of ZeroNet's use of third-party libraries. It lists as thoroughly as possible the third-party source code and binaries required to run [ZeroBundle](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroBundle) and [ZeroNet](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet).
